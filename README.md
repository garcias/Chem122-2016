# Visualization for Chem 122

This site describes visualization exercises for *Chemical Principles* (Chem 122) at Kenyon College, along with the files necessary to do them. The goals of these exercises include:

  - gain familiarity with visual conventions for discussing molecular structure 
  - infer spatial relationships in a molecule's structure using skeletal and wedge notation
  - convey spatial information to others using these kinds of notation
  - use computational tools for information-technology tasks, such as interconverting between structural notation and search-friendly notation, or studying spatial models of molecules

## Electronic tools

These exercises require access to a number of other web sites or web apps. Before starting, make sure you have a device and browser that can load the sites listed below. Most of these sites are easier to use with a physical keyboard. If any of these sites presents an accessibility problem, please consult with your instructor. 

  - **Jmol Console**: [garcias.github.io/jmol-console/](https://garcias.github.io/jmol-console/)
  - **Javascript Molecular Editor (JSME)**: [peter-ertl.com/jsme/](http://peter-ertl.com/jsme/)
  - **PubChem Project database**: [pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)
  - **Canadian Human Metabolome DataBase**: [www.hmdb.ca](http://www.hmdb.ca)
