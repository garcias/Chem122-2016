# Chem122-2016

This repository contains visualization exercises for *Chemical Principles 2016* (Chem 122) at Kenyon College, along with the code necessary to do them.

These exercises assume that you have a Cloud9 account and a Linux workspace ready to go. [Cloud9](https://c9.io) is a cloud-based computing environment. It allows you to control a remote Linux workspace through a browser-based web app called the Cloud9 IDE. 


## Getting started with Cloud9

You will receive an email invitation to join the `chem122` team at Cloud9. Accept the invitation and select **Create new account**. Select a display name, a username, and identify as a **student** doing **coursework**. You should *not* be asked for a credit card. Finish by selecting **Join team**. Check your email and click the activation link to set your password.

At your dashboard, click **Workspaces > Create a new workspace**. Set the following options:

- Workspace name: `vsepr`
- Team: `Chemical Principles`
- Hosted workspace: **Public**
- Clone from Git URL: `https://github.com/garcias/Chem122-2016.git`
- Choose a template: **Blank**

After a few minutes, Cloud9 will present a layout with a few tabs. Click through the guided tour, reading the comments if you are curious. Close the `README.md` tab to view the `Welcome` tab. Set the following options:

- Preset: **Full IDE**
- Main Theme: *light or dark, whichever is easiest on your eyes*
- Split Layout: **Two Horizontal Split**
- Editor Theme: *your preference, though Cloud9, Solarized, and Tomorrow themes are popular*
- Keyboard Mode: **Default** (unless you have a preference for Vim or Sublime)
- Soft Tabs: `4`

Close the `Welcome` tab.
